# Learn PHP Basic 

<p align="center">Hello everyone  <img src="https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/noto-emoji-animations/344/waving-hand_1f44b.gif" alt="waving" width="20" height="20"/>, here I am repeating and learning new things from the PHP programming language</p>

### Learn PHP Basic and  PHP OOP
<p>Here I re-learn about php basic, such as data types, mats, arrays, conditions, functions, loops, and others. And for PHP-OOP I learned about objects, classes, aliases, and others</p>

To see it you can go to the ***PHP-Basic*** branch / click this [Branch PHP-Basic and PHP-OOP](https://github.com/AdrianMiftahulH/Learn-PHP/tree/PHP-basic).
